      <h1>Kevin T. Baker</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a writer, researcher, editor, and sometimes programmer interested in
        the history of computers, simulation, and artificial intellegence in
        public life. I've written on subjects ranging from the <i>Limits to
          Growth</i> debate, the <a href="https://logicmag.io/play/model-metropolis/"> politics of <i>SimCity</i></a>, to simulation
        modeling in international development. </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I write about the history of computing and public policy at
        <a href="https://artificialbureaucracy.substack.com/"><i>Artificial
            Bureaucracy</i></a> and maintain an intermittently-updated
        reading list at <a href="https://kevinbaker.substack.com/"><i>Irregular Expressions</i></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a PhD in History from Northwestern University and did
        postdoctoral work in the Computer Science department at the University
        of California, Berkeley. Before academia, I worked for the National Archives and in
        the information technology sector. You can get a fuller idea of my
        background and interests by viewing my <a href="assets/ktb-vita.pdf">CV</a>.
